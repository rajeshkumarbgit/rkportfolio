        "problem": "The existing SATH notification system was struggling to handle the exponential growth in incident alerts. Users spent 40+ minutes configuring complex notification rules, and the rigid interface led to frequent misconfigurations causing alert fatigue. The technical debt from a 5-year-old codebase made it impossible to scale features without breaking existing functionality.\n\nKey pain points included: overwhelming cognitive load from poorly structured rule builder, lack of real-time validation causing configuration errors discovered only after deployment, no visibility into rule effectiveness or alert patterns, and 47% of support tickets related to notification misconfiguration.",

We implemented a component-based design system enabling consistent patterns across 50+ screens while maintaining flexibility for edge cases.",
